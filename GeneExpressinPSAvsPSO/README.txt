The contents of this folder contain three different programing files. 
1.R-project-DataScience final- This contains an r programming file that was use in order to download the geo dataset
from the NIH.It was also used to find significantly expressed genes as r seems to have some good packages used to do this. After that 
I switched to python because I am more familiar with python for programming machine learning models
2.Unfiltered model- This .py file contains a machine learning model to different between psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis...this files
machine learning model does not use a significant genes to reduce the dimesions in the data.This was added so we can see the difference between
the filtered and unfiltered gene models.
3.Filtered  model - This .py file is very simialar to our unfiltered model except we filtered out the genes so it only contained the significantly 
expressed genes between psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. It shows the usefullness in improving accuracy of models if we seperate the two different models.
4.My final project report as a pdf.
5.Data files that I saved in order to cross between R and python have been included as well.
